Usage
-----

There's no need to configure anything to run the application. Just execute this
command to run the built-in web server and access the application in your
browser at <http://localhost:8000>:

```bash
$ cd symfony-demo/
$ make up
```

To see all commands available run:

```bash
$ cd symfony-demo/
$ make
```

Alternatively, you can [configure a fully-featured web server][2] like Nginx
or Apache to run the application.

Tests
-----

```bash
$ cd symfony-demo/
$ make test
```

Or this command to run tests and get the coverage:
